## What is ClawGuard?

AI agents ask too many questions. Every `npm install`, every `git push` — confirm, confirm, confirm. You said yes 5 minutes ago; now it's asking again.

ClawGuard remembers. When you approve an operation, it's stored. Next time the same pattern appears — in this session, another agent, or a different tool — auto-allowed. Your trust decisions travel across Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and any hook-compatible agent.

Dangerous operations (`rm -rf`, `git push --force`, `curl|bash`) are still caught automatically. But that's not why you install ClawGuard — you install it because your agents get faster and quieter.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
npm install -g @clawguard-sec/cli

# Initialize (sets up hooks for your AI agent)
claw-guard init

# Verify installation
claw-guard test
```

## How It Works

```
First time:     Agent tries `npm install foo`
                    → ClawGuard asks → You allow → Remembered ✓

Second time:    Agent tries `npm install foo`
                    → Auto-allowed (no interruption) ✓

Dangerous:      Agent tries `rm -rf /`
                    → Always blocked, always explained ✗
```

## Choose How Quiet

Pick a preset that matches your comfort level — from maximum visibility to near-silence:

| Preset | Style | Low Risk | Medium Risk | High Risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `observer` | Watch only | log | log | log |
| `guardian` | Asks often | allow | confirm | deny |
| `balanced` | **Recommended** | allow | confirm | confirm |
| `expert` | Almost silent | allow | allow | confirm |

Minimum config — just one line in `clawguard.yaml`:

```yaml
profile: balanced
```

### Priority

CLI args > Project (`.clawguard.yaml`) > Global (`~/.config/clawguard/`) > Default (`balanced`)

## Architecture

### 2-Layer Design

**Layer 1 — Smart Approval** (hooks-based, no Docker required)
- Cross-agent decision memory (SQLite) — remembers what you approved
- Community reputation data in confirm dialogs — see what others decided
- Adapter → Policy Engine → allow/confirm/deny (under 100ms)
- Security Passport for compliance proof

**Layer 2 — Infrastructure Isolation** (Docker, optional)
- 3 containers: gateway / fetcher / agent
- Network segmentation (agent cannot reach external)

## Built-in Safety Net

ClawGuard silently catches dangerous operations. You don't need to configure anything — 12 rules ship by default.

### Core Rules (12)

| ID | Tool | Risk | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `BASH.RM_RISK` | bash | high | `rm -rf` recursive force delete |
| `BASH.GIT_RESET_HARD` | bash | high | `git reset --hard` |
| `BASH.GIT_CLEAN_FDX` | bash | high | `git clean -fdx` |
| `BASH.GIT_PUSH_FORCE` | bash | high | `git push --force` |
| `BASH.CHMOD_777` | bash | medium | `chmod 777` world-writable |
| `BASH.ROOT_PATH_OP` | bash | high | Operations targeting `/` |
| `BASH.PIPE_EXEC_001` | bash | high | `curl \| bash` pipe execution |
| `BASH.PIPE_EXEC_002` | bash | high | `wget \| sh` pipe execution |
| `BASH.SSH_KEY_READ` | bash | medium | SSH key file access |
| `BASH.ENV_FILE_READ` | bash | medium | `.env` file access |
| `BASH.NPM_INSTALL` | bash | medium | `npm install <package>` |
| `BASH.PIP_INSTALL` | bash | medium | `pip install <package>` |

### When Does ClawGuard Ask?

| Condition | What happens | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Already approved (same session/history) | **Silent — auto-allowed** | `npm install express` (approved before) |
| No rule matched | **Silent — proceeds normally** | `git status`, `ls`, `npm test` |
| Rule matched + preset = **confirm** | Asks with data-backed explanation | `npm install unknown-pkg` |
| Rule matched + preset = **deny** | Blocked with explanation | `rm -rf /` in `guardian` mode |

### Important Limitations

| Condition | Why ClawGuard Cannot Intervene |
|---|---|
| AI agent refuses the command on its own | The tool call never happens, so the PreToolUse hook never fires. This is defense-in-depth — the agent's own safety layer acts upstream of ClawGuard. |
| Running in `bypassPermissions` or `dontAsk` mode | ClawGuard skips evaluation in these permission modes. |
| Hook not installed | Run `claw-guard init` to register the PreToolUse hook. |

> **Note:** To verify ClawGuard's rule matching directly, use `claw-guard test` or pipe JSON to `claw-guard evaluate --json`.

## CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `claw-guard init` | Set up for your AI agent environment |
| `claw-guard evaluate --json` | Evaluate a tool request (hook entry point) |
| `claw-guard test` | Validate rules, engine, and configuration |
| `claw-guard stats` | View auto-allow count and decision summary |
| `claw-guard serve` | HTTP hook server (1-3ms latency) |
| `claw-guard log` | View audit log |
| `claw-guard dashboard` | Open web dashboard |
| `claw-guard feed` | Manage threat feed (`--update`, `--status`) |
| `claw-guard marketplace` | Manage rule packs (`installed`, `install`, `remove`) |
| `claw-guard passport` | Security passport & GitHub badges |
| `claw-guard replay` | Incident replay & causal analysis |
| `claw-guard report` | Weekly safety report |
| `claw-guard monitor` | False positive monitoring |
| `claw-guard docker` | Docker deployment (`init`, `up`, `down`) |
| `claw-guard skills` | Skills AV scanning |

### Rule Format (YAML)

```yaml
- id: BASH.RM_RISK
  match:
    tool: bash
    command_regex: '(?:^|\s|;|&&|\|\|)rm\s+.*(-rf|-fr)\b'
  risk: high
  explain:
    title: "Bulk deletion risk"
    what: "Recursively deletes files and directories."
    why:
      - "Wrong path can destroy entire project."
    check:
      - "Is the target path correct?"
      - "Do you have backups/commits?"
    alternatives:
      - "Run `ls` first to verify targets"
  meta:
    author: "clawguard"
    pack: "core"
    version: "1.0.0"
    tags: ["destructive"]
    phase: 0
```
